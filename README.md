#### HackSussex Game Jam WIzard game

## What is this?
This is a roguelike cavern-crawler inspired by classic games such as Rogue, Nethack, and Dwarf Fortress, where you (ostensibly lmao) play as a wizard. <br>
The game was originally made in 24 hrs for the HackSussex 2023 gamejam, but is still being updated/maintained.

## Features
Dig!<br>
Fight! - or walk into your enemies<br>
Cast an spell! -nb. More spells hopefully coming.<br>

## Upcoming features?
Loot/enemy drops
Win and loose states
Fishing minigame? All indie games have to have them after all

## Known issues
Monsters dont spawn in the build. For some reason.<br>
Monsters also don't move because Lye can't use Unities colliders ig.<br>
